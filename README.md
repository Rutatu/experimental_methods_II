# experimental_methods_II

***This repository contains portfolio assignments and descriptions of the assignments (as pdf files), which were done during the experimental methods II course as part of Cognitive Science BAÂ´s degree at Aarhus University***

***2019 spring semester***



## About the course
The course consists of two main parts: During the first part of the course, students are introduced to how the general linear model is used in the analysis of brain
scan data, for example those deducted from an fMRI and EEG/MEG scan. The range of methods of analysis is increased in the second part of the course to include multivariate
analyses.



## Portfolio assignments

| Assignment | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Portfolio 1: Regression | Sleep deprivation excercise where we look at response time as a function of days of sleep deprivation and practice linear regression analysis method  |
| Portfolio 2: Vectors and matrices | In this excercise we are looking at response time as a function of days of sleep deprivation using matrices. It consists of 4 parts: Linear regression, Images and matrices, Brains and matrices, Two equations with two unknowns|
| Portfolio 3: fMRI regression | fMRI single voxel data excercise. We analyse a time-series from a single voxel in auditory cortex (transverse temporal gyrus, MNI coordinate: [-46,-20,6], with all time-points converted into a vector). The task is to perform a regresion with  hemodynamic response to the different story types (fiction and factual) as independent variables using different models and also adding an additional covariate |
| Portfolio 4: fMRI preprocessing | In this exercise we are preparing fMRI data for analysis and look at some of the output. We look at all the fMRI data from one participant |
| Portfolio 5: Model specification | In this exercise, we make a model for the analysis of the data that we preprocessed in Portfolio 4. The model is specified by onsets for the different stories and by their duration, the onsets for emotional ratings of the stories |
| Portfolio 6: fMRI model estimation | In this exercise, we estimate the model of the data that we designed in Portfolio 4. We get the results and report them, if there are any. An SPM software package (Matlab) was used to obtain the results. For comparison of different conditions we employ T-contrast and F-contrast|
| Portfolio 7: Mixed effects | We practice mixed effects models (including 2-way and 3-way interactions) using data from to experimental studies: Emotional faces experiment & Tryptophan depletion study analysis|
| Portfolio 8: EEG Stop-Signal-NoGo | Reporting results of an EEG data after conducting the preprocessing |
| Portfolio 9: fMRI group analysis | We investigate the fMRI brain scans from emotional face experiment which consists of the following parts: Preprocessing and modeling of individual participants, Investigating analysis of a single participant, Group analysis |
| Portfolio 10: PCA factor analysis | Real World Immitating Task employing Principal Component Analysis and Factor analysis  |
