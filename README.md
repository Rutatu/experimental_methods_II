# experimental_methods_II

This repository contains portfolio assignments and descriptions of the assignments (as pdf files), which were done during the experimental methods II course as part of Cognitive Science BAÂ´s degree at Aarhus University (class 2018).

## About the course
The course consists of two main parts: During the first part of the course, students are introduced to how the general linear model is used in the analysis of brain
scan data, for example those deducted from an fMRI and EEG/MEG scan. The range of methods of analysis is increased in the second part of the course to include multivariate
analyses.
